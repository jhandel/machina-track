# User Management Feature

## Overview
Added a comprehensive user management system to the Settings page, allowing administrators to manage user accounts with full CRUD operations.

## Features

### Users Tab in Settings
- **Location**: Settings → Users tab
- **Access**: Available to all authenticated users (consider adding role-based access control in the future)

### Core Functionality

#### 1. User List View
- Displays all users in a table format
- Shows: Name, Email, Created Date, Actions
- Real-time loading states
- Empty state handling

#### 2. Create User
- Modal form with validation
- Required fields: Name, Email, Password
- Email uniqueness validation
- Password minimum length (6 characters)
- Success/error notifications

#### 3. Reset Password
- Button available for each user (key icon)
- Modal form for entering new password
- Password validation (minimum 6 characters)
- Updates user password with bcrypt hashing

#### 4. Delete User
- Button available for each user (trash icon)
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Prevents deletion of the last remaining user
- Cascades to delete related accounts and sessions

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/users
- Returns list of all users (excluding passwords)
- Requires authentication
- Response includes: id, name, email, emailVerified, createdAt, updatedAt

### POST /api/users
- Creates a new user account
- Validates input data
- Checks for email uniqueness
- Hashes password with bcrypt
- Returns created user data (excluding password)

### GET /api/users/[id]
- Returns specific user data (excluding password)
- Requires authentication

### PUT /api/users/[id]
- Updates user password only
- Validates password requirements
- Hashes new password with bcrypt
- Returns updated user data

### DELETE /api/users/[id]
- Deletes user account
- Prevents deletion of last user
- Cascades to delete related data
- Requires authentication

## Technical Implementation

### Files Added/Modified

#### New Files
- `src/app/api/users/route.ts` - User list and creation endpoints
- `src/app/api/users/[id]/route.ts` - User-specific operations
- `src/services/user-service.ts` - High-level user service layer
- `src/app/(app)/settings/components/UsersTab.tsx` - User management UI

#### Modified Files
- `src/services/api-client.ts` - Added user API methods
- `src/services/index.ts` - Exported user service
- `src/app/(app)/settings/page.tsx` - Added users tab

### Database Schema
Uses existing NextAuth.js User model:
```prisma
model User {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  name          String?
  email         String    @unique
  emailVerified DateTime?
  image         String?
  password      String?
  createdAt     DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime  @updatedAt
  accounts      Account[]
  sessions      Session[]
}
```

### Security Features
- Password hashing with bcrypt (salt rounds: 12)
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Authentication required for all operations
- Email uniqueness enforcement
- Prevents deletion of last user account
- Secure password handling (never returned in responses)

### UI/UX Features
- Responsive design with mobile-friendly layout
- Loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications for success/error feedback
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Form validation with clear error messages
- Accessible design with proper ARIA labels

## Usage

1. **Navigate to Settings**: Go to Settings page from the main navigation
2. **Select Users Tab**: Click on the "Users" tab
3. **Create User**: Click "Create User" button to add new accounts
4. **Reset Password**: Click the key icon next to any user to reset their password
5. **Delete User**: Click the trash icon to remove a user account (with confirmation)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Role-based Access Control**: Add user roles (admin, user, viewer)
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple users for bulk actions
- **User Activity Logs**: Track user login/logout activity
- **Password Policies**: Enforce stronger password requirements
- **Email Verification**: Send verification emails for new accounts
- **User Profile Management**: Allow users to edit their own profiles
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Add 2FA support
- **User Groups**: Organize users into groups or departments

### Security Considerations
- Consider adding rate limiting for user creation
- Implement session management for concurrent logins
- Add audit logs for user management actions
- Consider adding password reset via email functionality
- Add account lockout after failed login attempts

## Testing

The user management system has been tested for:
- ✅ User creation with validation
- ✅ Password reset functionality
- ✅ User deletion with safeguards
- ✅ API error handling
- ✅ UI state management
- ✅ Authentication integration

## Dependencies

- **bcryptjs**: Password hashing
- **zod**: Input validation
- **@prisma/client**: Database operations
- **NextAuth.js**: Authentication framework
- **Radix UI**: UI components (Dialog, AlertDialog, Table)
- **Lucide React**: Icons (Users, Plus, Key, Trash2)
